# Clear Search Tabs

A Chrome extension that adds a keyboard shortcut to close all google search tabs you have open in the current window.

Basically it's a selective version of the `Cmd + Shift + W` shortcut that closes all `google.com/search*` tabs.

Default keyboard shortcut is `Cmd + Shift + E` (or `Ctrl + Shift + E` on windows).
